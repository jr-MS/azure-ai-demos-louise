Final Report:
# Renewable Energy Investment, Capacity, and Consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Introduction:** Sub-Saharan Africa’s energy landscape is defined by low per-capita consumption, uneven access, and a growing push towards renewables. The region accounts for only a small fraction of global energy investment and capacity, but recent trends show acceleration in renewable energy deployment【66:1†source】,【66:4†source】. Below, we present data on **investment in renewable energy**, **energy generation capacity (especially renewables)**, and **energy consumption patterns** across Sub-Saharan African countries, highlighting notable cases and regional trends.

## Investment in Renewable Energy

Renewable energy investment in Africa has historically been very low relative to the world. Only about **2% of global renewable energy investments in the last two decades** were made in Africa【66:1†source】. In 2021, just **$2.6 billion** was invested in renewables in all of Africa – a mere **0.6%** of the **$434 billion** global total that year. This 2021 figure marked an 11-year low, reflecting the **continent’s underinvestment** despite abundant resources. However, there has since been a notable uptick. **2023 was a record year**, with an estimated **$15 billion** invested in renewables across Africa – more than double the previous year【66:4†source】. Even so, this was only **2.3% of global renewable investment** in 2023【66:4†source】, underscoring that Africa’s share remains disproportionately small compared to its need.

Importantly, investment has been **concentrated in a few countries**. **South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, and Kenya** together account for about **three-quarters of all renewable energy asset investment in Africa since 2010**【66:11†source】. South Africa alone has attracted major financing, including an $8.5 billion **Just Energy Transition Partnership** announced in 2022 to support its shift from coal to renewables【66:3†source】. Kenya is another leader, especially in geothermal and wind projects – for example, a **record $3.2 billion** investment went into two new geothermal plants in Kenya in 2023【66:4†source】. By contrast, most other Sub-Saharan countries have received far less funding【66:10†source】. This imbalance is evident in 2021 data: **South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco** drew the bulk of funds, while many countries saw little or no large-scale renewable investment. Recent policy changes are improving prospects in some nations (for instance, **Nigeria’s removal of fuel subsidies in 2023 spurred ~$2 billion in solar investments** as businesses and households turn to solar【66:4†source】). Overall, though, **clean energy investment in Sub-Saharan Africa is rising but still falls short** of what’s needed. According to the International Energy Agency, achieving Africa’s energy and climate goals by 2030 would require **over $200 billion of energy investment per year**, with two-thirds of that in clean energy – far above current levels.

## Energy Capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa

Sub-Saharan Africa’s **total installed electricity capacity** remains small relative to global figures, and much of it is not yet from renewables. *Africa as a whole* had about **59–62 GW of renewable generation capacity** in 2022–2023, which is **under 3% of global renewable capacity**,. This represents substantial growth (African renewables **doubled from ~30 GW in 2012 to ~59 GW in 2022**), yet in absolute terms it is very modest – in 2023, Africa’s renewables were only **1.6% of the world’s renewable capacity**. Renewables now make up about **24% of Africa’s total power capacity** (the rest being fossil fuels), up from ~19% a decade ago. In Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, renewable capacity is dominated by a few countries and by hydropower resources.

**Table 1: Top Sub-Saharan African Countries by Renewable Electricity Capacity (2022)** 

| Country             | Installed Renewable Capacity (GW) |
|---------------------|----------------------------------:|
| **South Africa**    | **10.44** GW          |
| **Ethiopia**        | **5.59** GW           |
| **Angola**          | **4.08** GW          |
| **Zambia**          | **3.30** GW          |
| **Dem. Rep. Congo** | **2.74** GW          |
| **Kenya**           | **2.66** GW          |
| **Mozambique**      | **2.32** GW          |
| **Nigeria**         | **2.16** GW          |
| **(for reference) Egypt*    | *6.32 GW*     |
| **(for reference) Morocco*  | *3.73 GW*    |

*Table 1:* South Africa leads Sub-Saharan Africa in installed renewable capacity, with over 10 GW (about **17% of the continent’s renewables** ). Ethiopia, Angola, and Kenya are next, each in the 2–6 GW range. Notably, **just five countries (South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, Angola)** hold **about half of all Africa’s renewable capacity**, reflecting the concentration of resources. Most of the capacity in Ethiopia, D.R. Congo, Zambia, Angola, and Mozambique is **large-scale hydropower**, which has traditionally been the backbone of renewable electricity in Africa【66:5†source】,. Hydropower accounts for roughly **two-thirds of Africa’s total renewable capacity** (as of 2023). For example, Ethiopia’s nearly **100% renewable electricity** comes primarily from big dams (such as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam)【66:9†source】, and Angola’s recent expansion is almost **90% from one major hydro project**【66:5†source】. 

On the other hand, *non-hydro* renewables (solar, wind, geothermal) are growing fast from a small base. **Solar power** in particular has surged: the continent’s solar capacity jumped from 1.6 GW in 2014 to **13.5 GW by 2023**, with **South Africa** alone contributing about 6 GW of that (through utility-scale projects and a boom in small-scale rooftop installations),【66:4†source】. **Wind power** climbed from 2.4 GW in 2014 to **8.6 GW in 2023**, driven mainly by new wind farms in South Africa, Morocco, and Egypt. **Geothermal** is niche but significant for Kenya (which has nearly 1 GW of geothermal, making up a large share of its 2.7 GW renewable capacity)【66:9†source】. Kenya’s grid is now about **80% renewable** (mix of geothermal, hydro, wind),【66:9†source】. South Africa, by contrast, still has a **much larger total capacity (~58 GW)** when including its coal plants, so renewables form only around **17%** of its installed capacity . Many smaller countries (like **Ethiopia, DRC, Lesotho, Uganda**) already obtain **over 90% of their electricity from renewables** – but this is largely because they have limited generation capacity which happens to be hydro-based【66:9†source】,【66:9†source】.

**Figure 1** illustrates the regional distribution of renewable capacity. As of 2021, *East and Southern Africa* led in both existing and forthcoming renewable capacity, far outpacing Central and West Africa ,. Southern Africa (dominated by South Africa’s projects) had **over 10 GW of new capacity in the pipeline**, and East Africa’s capacity was set to more than double with projects under construction, whereas **North Africa** had relatively little new capacity coming online (having already built significant projects earlier).

   *Figure 1: Renewable energy capacity in Africa by region (bars indicate current installed capacity and capacity under construction as of 2021),.* 

Overall, Sub-Saharan Africa’s renewable capacity is growing but remains **small in global context**. There is a *vast untapped potential* in solar, wind, and hydro. The African Union has set a target of **300 GW of renewables by 2030**, which would require an almost four-fold increase from the ~72 GW installed in 2022,. Reaching this goal will depend on continued investment growth, supportive policies (such as regular renewable energy auctions and improved grid infrastructure), and the success of programs like South Africa’s REIPPP (Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme) that have driven most of the recent additions【66:5†source】,【66:4†source】.

## Energy Consumption Patterns

**Energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa is marked by low averages, high disparities, and reliance on traditional fuels.**  On a per-capita basis, Africans consume far less electricity than the world average. For instance, **Nigeria’s annual electricity use is only about 182 kWh per person**, which is *extremely low* – roughly 20 times less than the world average and **one of the lowest per capita figures globally**. By contrast, **South Africa’s** consumption is about **3,780 kWh per capita**, on par with emerging economies like Brazil or Turkey and the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even Kenya, a mid-sized economy with a high renewable share, averaged only around **191 kWh per capita in 2023**. Many countries in the Sahel and Central Africa have per-capita usage below 100–150 kWh. **Niger**, for example, had the *lowest* electricity consumption per person in the world in 2022 at just **147 kWh**【66:2†source】. Table 2 compares a few countries:

**Table 2: Electricity Consumption per Capita – Selected Countries** 

| Country         | Annual per-capita electricity use (kWh) | 
|-----------------|----------------------------------------:|
| **South Africa**  | **~3,780** kWh (higher-middle income level) |
| **Kenya**         | **~191** kWh (rapidly rising with rural electrification) |
| **Nigeria**       | **~182** kWh (large population, low supply)   |
| **Niger**         | **147** kWh【66:2†source】 (among the lowest in the world) |

Such disparities reflect both **access to electricity** and **industrial demand**. South Africa’s higher usage comes from a relatively electrified population and an industrialized economy (mining, manufacturing) – but it also masks inequities (many rural or poor South African households still have limited power). Nigeria’s extremely low per-capita figure highlights its severe electricity access deficit: despite being Africa’s most populous nation, over **43% of Nigerians lack grid electricity**, and those with access face frequent outages, causing heavy reliance on backup generators,. In fact, more than **600 million people in Africa (about half the population) have no access to electricity at all**, the vast majority of them in Sub-Saharan countries【66:6†source】. This number has barely improved in recent years due to population growth outpacing new connections. A few countries are making strides – **Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda** are on track for **universal electricity access by 2030** through aggressive grid and off-grid expansion【66:12†source】 – but many others lag behind.

Because of low access and incomes, **traditional biomass fuels dominate energy consumption** in Sub-Saharan Africa. **Firewood and charcoal** used for cooking and heating form a huge part of the energy diet. In 2019, **45% of Africa’s total energy supply** was from biofuels and waste (mostly wood fuel), compared to only 9% globally【66:7†source】. This indicates that **a majority of households rely on burning wood or other biomass**, especially for cooking, due to lack of modern energy. While this boosts the share of “renewables” in a statistical sense (one report noted **55% of Africa’s final energy consumption was from renewables in 2021** when traditional biomass is included【66:12†source】), it actually signals energy poverty rather than sustainable energy use. Dependence on biomass has health and environmental consequences, and replacing it with modern energy is a development priority.

In terms of **overall energy use**, Sub-Saharan Africa’s share is very small. All of Africa (1.4 billion people) accounts for only about **3–4% of global electricity consumption**. In 2019, Africa’s total electricity demand was around **700 TWh** (terawatt-hours), of which **North African countries and South Africa alone made up over 70%**【66:8†source】. This means the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa – dozens of countries with over 800 million people – consumed only roughly 200 TWh (under 1% of world electricity) in 2019. Even with economic growth, **energy use per capita in most Sub-Saharan nations remains among the lowest in the world**. As a consequence, the region’s **CO₂ emissions are very low** (Africa contributes <3% of global CO₂). However, this also correlates with constrained economic development.

**Energy sources for electricity** vary by country, leading to different consumption patterns **in the power mix**. **Coal and natural gas still supply about 75% of Africa’s electricity generation**【66:10†source】 – largely due to South Africa’s coal-fired fleet and Nigeria’s gas turbines. In South Africa, coal has historically generated **over 80%** of electricity, enabling higher usage but also making South Africa by far the continent’s top emitter of CO₂. By contrast, countries like Ethiopia, DR Congo, and Zambia have almost all their consumption met by **renewable hydropower**【66:9†source】,【66:9†source】. Kenya’s grid mix is around **90% renewable** (geothermal, hydro, wind) in recent years,【66:9†source】, making it one of the cleanest electricity systems globally – though Kenya’s per-capita consumption is low. Many other nations rely on a **mix of hydro and fossil fuel generators** (oil/diesel plants are common in smaller grids). For example, **Ghana** and **Ivory Coast** use a mix of hydropower and natural gas; **Tanzania** and **Cameroon** have hydro plus some gas or oil. In countries with unreliable grids, a lot of consumption doesn’t show up in official data – for instance, Nigerians operate millions of private petrol/diesel generators to compensate for blackouts, which raises energy costs and has environmental drawbacks.

Another key pattern is the rise of **off-grid and small-scale energy**. Because expanding national grids is slow and costly, many communities and businesses turn to **decentralized solutions**. Solar home systems and **mini-grids** (often solar or hybrid) are increasingly providing basic power in rural areas. In Nigeria, the government’s Rural Electrification Agency and private firms have deployed hundreds of solar mini-grids to power villages and clinics【66:5†source】. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, off-grid solar additions are forecast to exceed 1 GW over the next few years【66:5†source】. While these off-grid systems significantly improve quality of life, they typically supply limited power (lighting, phone charging, small appliances) – contributing only marginally to total national consumption figures for now.

In summary, **Sub-Saharan Africa’s energy consumption profile** is characterized by **low overall usage, heavy reliance on fossil fuels for the electricity that is produced, and an outsize role of traditional biomass in households**. A small number of countries (South Africa above all) consume a large share of the region’s modern energy, while most others have very low consumption due to limited access and economic size. The challenge moving forward is twofold: **dramatically increase access and consumption** to fuel development, while **shifting the energy mix to cleaner sources**. Encouraging trends include the recent acceleration in renewable capacity investments and successful renewable projects in countries like Kenya and Ethiopia. If investments continue to grow – for instance, with sustained capital flows into solar, wind, and geothermal projects, and into supporting infrastructure like grids – Sub-Saharan Africa can simultaneously **expand energy access** and **increase the renewable share** of its energy consumption. Current projections are optimistic: renewables are expected to dominate new capacity additions going forward, and several countries aim for **50–100% clean power** in their mix within the next two decades. Yet, achieving these goals will require overcoming financial, technical, and policy barriers so that the region’s vast renewable resources translate into affordable, reliable energy for all.
